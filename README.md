# ASCII-Converter
An ASCII to text converter and comparison tool using Python 3.9.

This program converts ASCII to text and vide versa. The compare mode is a separate window that allows you to compare an ASCII file to normal text. When non-ASCII characters are entered in the compare mode window, they are filtered out by default. When non-ASCII characters are entered into the convert window, they are represented with a "?".

The GUI uses Tkinter.
The program is multithreaded because of the use of loops.
